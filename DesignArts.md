        </header>
        <p>
          An often-overlooked part of GIS is the visual aspect. It is not sufficient to just overlay some data points onto a map and let the reader sort it out; care must be taken in proper visualization of the data to convert what would otherwise just be shapes on a flat plane into a window to the condition of our world. As such, many art and design techniques are vital to consider.

          To the side is the result of my final project for one of my cartography courses. It and other more visually-aligned GIS results can be seen in more detail and context in some of the repositories below. As the maps are rather large and often detailed, seeing them in the full PDF files works more smoothly than shrinking them down to embed here.

        <p>
          Besides the direct lead-in from aerial photography and related techniques, regular digital photography has also been a minor interest of mine stretching back many years. After acquiring a more consistently usable camera several months ago, I've been dedicating time between other lessons to get more of an understanding of composition and image adjustment. Some recent examples are below, as well as elsewhere on the site.

          <h3>Traditional Art</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          In an effort to approach design from a different angle than my major was focused on, I took up some traditional 2D art courses after graduation to diversify and round out my understanding of visual mediums. Aside from the basic techniques for graphite & colored pencils, I found that there was substantial crossover from my main field of study in terms of approach. Estimations of height and depth of geographical features leads right in to perspective & 3D construction on a 2D plane. Azimuth and hillshade calculations translate to the shaping and intensity of shadows and highlights. The approaches of visual analysis and visual art are very similar, simply with one being descriptive and the other being prescriptive. By understanding the mechanics of how existing things look, one is more able to determine how something is ought to look during creation. Despite my very limited art supplies, unsteady hands, and limited scanning equipment, I believe these studies are able to demonstrate the crossover in my understanding from analysis to implementation.

        <h2>Web/Interface Design, Future Plans</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Web and interface design is currently my main objective and intended path of study. Aside from the vital mechanical exercises done for WebGIS and GIS Coding that cover the effective rendering of geo-information on a webpage, the visual aspect is what I more intend to look into. I fortunately have the experience of the creation of the <a href="https://a-hayes.github.io/GISTech.html#geohub">Africa GeoHUB</a> and of this website as a very solid base, but I look forward to opportunities to expand on this topic as they become available.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also very recently begun looking into the workings of the Unreal Engine, as the model work done in Unity for my <a href="https://a-hayes.github.io/GISTech.html#bridge">Terrain Explorer project</a> and in Maya for VIST-170 is another substantial aspect of what I look forward to. The way I see it, not only does interface design have the possibility to improve real-world (non-digital) interfaces, but to improve upon the rapidly growing VR/AR sphere as its utility and accessibility increases to more people.
