      <p>
        Web and interface design is currently my main objective and intended path of study. Aside from the vital mechanical exercises done for WebGIS and GIS Coding that cover the effective rendering of geo-information on a webpage, the visual aspect is what I more intend to look into. I fortunately have the experience of the creation of the <a href="https://a-hayes.github.io/GISTech.html#geohub">Africa GeoHUB</a> and of this website as a very solid base, but I look forward to opportunities to expand on this topic as they become available.

        I have also very recently begun looking into the workings of the Unreal Engine, as the model work done in Unity for my <a href="https://a-hayes.github.io/GISTech.html#bridge">Terrain Explorer project</a> and in Maya for VIST-170 is another substantial aspect of what I look forward to. The way I see it, not only does interface design have the possibility to improve real-world (non-digital) interfaces, but to improve upon the rapidly growing VR/AR sphere as its utility and accessibility increases to more people.
