			<h2>About</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			Asa Hayes is currently a graduate student at Texas A&M University, under the M.S. in Vizualization program. Starting with a B.S. in Geographic Information Science and Technology for major studies along with a Computer Science minor, he has worked to create a wide base of experience in several technical and artistic areas. By doing so, he hopes to find new perspectives and solutions for each and reduce crosstalk and confusion between these fields, as he believes that they are more deeply tied than many people in either sometimes notice.

			<h2>Future Interests</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			Aside from continuing & finishing the current program, Asa's interests towards future efforts are varied. His current main focus is on a capstone project, oriented towards game design with efforts towards creating a game demo, which will likely carry over into trying to enter the game development industry. Additional options are towards the GIS field, or even some combination of GIS & games.
