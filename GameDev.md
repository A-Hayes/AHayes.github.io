        Inti is a puzzle platformer adventure made in Unreal Engine 5.2, where an ancient civilization used to worship the god of the sun. However, a mysterious curse left the world in an eternal darkness. The player’s goal as the protagonist is to restore the light to this world by collecting three relics and reactivating the sundial found in the sun god’s temple.

		Inti was created by our team as the main project for VIST-480: Game Level Design at Texas A&M, where we were tasked with each designing a level for a combined cohesive game. My role (besides level design) was managing the technical aspects of the project (i.e. troubleshooting, building/packaging, Git management, etc.) along with mechanical development for movement and blueprints.
